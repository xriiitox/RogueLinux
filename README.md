# RogueLinux

A FOSS roguelike launcher for linux distros, made with C#, .NET, and AvaloniaUI!

## Features

* Install games
* Play games
* Uninstall games
* Yeah its pretty barebones
* No NetHack Unfortunately (they don't distribute linux binaries)

## Usage

Download from releases and run the executable.

I might package this as an AppImage later for fun.

## Contribution

Feel free to fork and make a PR!

New games can be added by putting a json in the `RogueLinux/json` folder along with an image to go with it, in `RogueLinux/Assets`.

## Libraries Used

* .NET 8 + C#
* [AvaloniaUI](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia)
* [MessageBox.Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaCommunity/MessageBox.Avalonia)
